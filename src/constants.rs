        Welcome to our Epub Reader. This application, developed in Rust language in collaboration with the Politecnico di Torino, allows you to read your digital 
        books in epub format. In addition to reading and searching for chapters, the application authorizes the user to edit their books and save them.
        Also, you can search for the first occurrence of a given string.
        The implementation of OCR involves the management of two buttons:
            - üì∑ ‚ûú Starting from a chosen photo of the book you have taken, you can go directly to the page in digital version;
            - üñºÔ∏è ‚ûú Starting from a digital page it is possible to view the photo relating to the book page if this has been previously recognized.\n\n
        Hoping that the app is to your liking, a greeting from the developers
    
        Giorgio Daniele Luppina
        Claudio Di Maida";
